        "description": "Overview:\n\n4-band resistors are identified by four colored bands that convey essential information about their resistance value.\n\nDetails:\n\n- First Significant Digit: Represents the first significant digit of the resistance value.\n- Second Significant Digit: Represents the second significant digit of the resistance value.\n- Multiplier: Indicates the multiplier, i.e., the number of zeros to append to the significant digits.\n- Tolerance: Represents the tolerance of the resistor, indicating the acceptable range of the resistance value.\n\nCalculation:\n\nCombine the values of the first two bands, multiply by the multiplier, and apply the tolerance.\n\nBenefits:\n\nThe 4-band resistor coding system is simple and commonly used."
